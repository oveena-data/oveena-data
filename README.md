### Hi there, I'm Oveena ðŸ‘‹  
A data scientist and software developer with a passion to use data to solve real-world problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:  
  Real-time model deployment, advanced time series analysis, and scalable data pipelines with tools like Docker for containerisation.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:  
  Advanced feature selection techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and applying machine learning tools like Scikit-learn for model inference and optimization. Also exploring dimensionality reduction (ex: PCA, t-SNE) and algorithmic efficiency for large-scale datasets.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:  
  Projects involving predictive maintenance, time series modeling (ex: ARIMA/Prophet), smart infrastructure, and secure data pipelines and all things innovative!

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:  
  Exploring best praactices in MLOps, feature stores, and applying data science techniques impactfully.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:  
  Real-time model deployment, typing biometrics, satellite manufacturing insights, statistical analysis, or getting started in tech/entrepreneurship.
