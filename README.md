### Hi there, Oveena here ðŸ‘‹  
A data scientist and software developer with a passion to use data to solve real-world problems.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a final year Computer Science Student at the University of Adelaide, Australia. I am learning advanced feature selection techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and applying machine learning tools like Scikit-learn for model inference and optimization. Also exploring dimensionality reduction (ex: PCA, t-SNE) and algorithmic efficiency for large-scale datasets.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:  
  Projects involving all things data and innovative!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:  
  Real-time model deployment, typing biometrics, satellite manufacturing insights, statistical analysis, or getting started in tech/entrepreneurship.

### ðŸŒŸ Inspired By

> I'm deeply inspired by **Cassie Kozyrkov**, the founder of Decision Intelligence and former Chief Decision Scientist at Google. Her work in integrating data science with human decision-making has profoundly influenced my approach to data-driven solutions. Cassie's ability to bridge complex AI concepts with practical applications motivates me to pursue innovative paths in data science and beyond.
