# Hi there, Oveena here ðŸ‘‹  

A data scientist and software developer with a passion to use data to solve real-world problems.

<details>
  <summary>ðŸŒ± About Me</summary>
  <br>
  Iâ€™m currently a final year Computer Science Student, majoring in Data Science, at the University of Adelaide, Australia.  
  I'm learning advanced feature selection techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and applying machine learning tools like Scikit-learn for model inference and optimisation.  
  Also exploring dimensionality reduction (such as: PCA, t-SNE) and algorithmic efficiency for large-scale datasets.

## âš¡ Fun Facts:  

My first data science project involved analyzing traffic and population trends for urban planning and won 2nd place at GovHack Australia ðŸ¥ˆ  

### ðŸ§  What I'm Building  

ðŸš€ **Co-founder & Data Engineer (Product & Market)** at [**Typpio**](https://www.typpio.com/)  

We're blending behavioral authentication with real-time typing patterns to secure digital identities.

### ðŸŒŸ Inspired By

> I'm deeply inspired by **Cassie Kozyrkov**, the founder of Decision Intelligence and former Chief Decision Scientist at Google. Her work in integrating data science with human decision-making has profoundly influenced my approach to data-driven solutions. Cassie's ability to bridge complex AI concepts with practical applications motivates me. I don't just want to use data, I want to innovate with it.
