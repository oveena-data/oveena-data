### Hi there, I'm Oveena ðŸ‘‹  
A data scientist and software developer passionate about using data to solve real-world problems in critical industries like energy, space, and security.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:  
  A real-time typing biometrics authentication API using keystroke dynamics and anomaly detection-focused on reliability, security, and real-time inference.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:  
  Advanced feature selection techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and applying machine learning tools like Scikit-learn for model inference and optimization. Also exploring dimensionality reduction (ex: PCA, t-SNE) and algorithmic efficiency for large-scale datasets.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:  
  Projects involving predictive maintenance, time series modeling (ex: ARIMA/Prophet), smart infrastructure, and secure data pipelines and all things innovative!

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:  
  Boosting my career in data science and helping find projects that help me contribute to meaningful spaces.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:  
  Real-time model deployment, typing biometrics, satellite manufacturing insights, statistical analysis, or getting started in data science.
